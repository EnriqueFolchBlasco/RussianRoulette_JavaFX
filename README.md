# RussianRoulette_JavaFX
Made in javaFX using scenebuilder, russian roulette type game, with some variety of options.

Althought the project is called spanish roulette, is an attempt to recreate the famous game about a revolver and the bullet that  keeps moving as long as you shot or spin, the game consists in you selecting how many persons wanna play (from 2 to 6) and later on adding their names, since it's scene builder and this is my first year using java it's kinda basic ( I gotta admit it, althought was made with love).

The game gives you the options to shoot, spin the gun and shoot, and to see the chamber of the bullets in case you wanna check that the game is correctly functioning.

It's a basic game that since I was a teenager always thought it would be fun to try to understand how to do it, and seems I have done it, atleast the basics of it, resetting the data after the game ends ain't really a preocupation for me.

Here you can see the option to select how many players will be in the game, from 2 to 6 players.

After selecting the amount of players you will be asked to introduce the players names.

Afterwards, in the "gameplay" pane, you will see various things such as some blocks that count some stats, a button to shoot and other to spin and shoot. You will also be able to see the current player which "has the pistol in it's hands" and the next player.

As a optional feature, in order to feel that the game isn't just a random feature, I added the button to peek the bullets chamber, this way you can see how the bullet moves.
