# RussianRoulette_JavaFX
Made in javaFX using scenebuilder, russian roulette type game.

Althought the project is called spanish roulette, is an attempt to recreate the famous game about a revolver and the bullet that  keeps moving as long as you shot or spin, the game consists in you selecting how many persons wanna play (from 2 to 6) and later on adding their names, since it's scene builder and this is my first year using java it's kinda basic ( I gotta admit it, althought was made with love).

The game gives you the options to shoot, spin the gun and shoot, and to see the chamber of the bullets in case you wanna check that the game is correctly functioning.
